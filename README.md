Number Ninjas

This project is designed to create a fun learning experience for children in elementary school who want a fun way to learn math. It utilizes pygame in order to create an intutive GUI along with multiple screens which include the main page, progress screen, main game page, tutorial screen, scoreboard, sign up, sign in, teacher mode, and moderator mode.

This game is Python based and runs on Pygame, and tests on Pytest, so these must be installed. All steps to install Pygame can be found here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted. All steps to install Pytest can be found here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html. Our unit tests also utilize unittest, but this does not require installation. To run both tests, simply type “pytest” in the terminal. To play the game, simply run the Game.py file to play.
